# PHYS4150-Computational-Physics-Course-Code

## Description

This GitHub Repository is set up to store the course code of PHYS4150 - Computational Physics at The University of Hong Kong . This course includes 

1. Solving linear ODE with Euler method, Velocity Verlet method and 4th order Runge Kutta method 
2. Solving PDE with Jacobi relaxation, Gauss-Seidel Relaxation, Successive Overrelaxation, and Numerov matrix method. 
3. von Neumann stability analysis 
4. Exact diagonalization of the given Hamiltonian of a physical system (e.g. Transverse field Ising Model and Heisenberg Model)

There are 2 main motivations for me setting to set up this repository 

1. To back up my code for PHYS4150 course work
2. To serve as a benchmark for people to learn computational physics by doing. 

Detailed description of the purpose of the code will be explained in the corresponding pdf file.

## How to Install and Run the code

I am using [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run the jupyter Notebook.  

You can also using uploading the code to Google drive and run it in Google Colab.
